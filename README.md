# Bike Shop
Author: Kelvin Bastow

# Project

My Projects is to build an application allowing a 'Bikeshop' to organise their customers, products and orders. With list of bikes in stock, a customer list with relevant information, and then an order list for easy referencing.

# Requirements

A Trello board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project. It could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced creating your project.

A relational database used to store data persistently for the project, this database needs to have at least 2 tables in it, to demonstrate your understanding, you are also required to model a relationship.

Clear Documentation from a design phase describing the architecture you will use for you project as well as a detailed Risk Assessment. A functional CRUD application created in Python, following best practices and design principles, that meets the requirements set on your Kanban Board.

Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, as well as automated tests for validation of the application. You must provide high test coverage in your backend and provide consistent reports and evidence to support a TDD approach.

A functioning front-end website and integrated API's, using Flask. Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the Feature-Branch model which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.

# Database Diagram

A Diagram Showing How My Databases Interact, whilst this diagram shows 6 databases, there are only three. Add Customer and Add Product are separate tables, and then when you input the data into the text boxes and completing the required Info this will then update the data base and take you to the relevant page (Customer/Product List), then you can create an order, again inputting the required data and this will then create an order and then once the order has been created, will take you to the Order List Page.
